"Determine the maximum number of spins in an optimal solution to a 3x3 Spinpossible board that only allows 2x2 square, 3x1 row, and 1x3 column spins"

If you are interested in the two boards that require 12 steps to solve, here they are: 

 -1  4 -7
  2 -5  8
 -3  6 -9

 -9  6 -3
  8 -5  2
 -7  4 -1



I run the program including the 1x2, 3x3 spin:

0	1	        0 sec.
1	11	        3 sec.
2	85	        2 sec.
3	583	        3 sec.
4	3649	        3 sec.
5	20167	3 sec.
6	90308	3 sec.
7	284370	6 sec.
8	489804	9 sec.
9	418430	8 sec.
10	153137	4 sec.
11	13717	3 sec.
12	296	        3 sec.
13	2	        2 sec.
total	1474560	56 sec.

185 794 560 / 1 474 560 = 126

and the two hardest ones are: 

  1 -4  7
 -2  5 -8
  3 -6  9

  9 -6  3
 -8  5 -2
  7 -4  1



Excluding 1x1 spins: 

0	1	          0 sec.
1	27	          3 sec.
2	481	          2 sec.
3	7253	          3 sec.
4	99522	  5 sec.
5	1241500	  37 sec.
6	13142978	  352 sec.
7	84140870	  2231 sec.
8	86625375	  2294 sec.
9	536553	  17 sec.
total	185794560	  4946 sec.

So excluding single spins does not increase the lower bound of 9 spins. 

excluding 1x1 and 1x2 spins: 

0	1	  	  0 sec.
1	15	  	  2 sec.
2	161	  	  3 sec.
3	1577   	  2 sec.
4	14677	  3 sec.
5	130305	  4 sec.
6	1097267	  21 sec.
7	8530820	  138 sec.
8	52149572	  821 sec.
9	111501265	  1745 sec.
10	12368367	  197 sec.
11	533	  	  2 sec.
total	185794560	  2941 sec.

and excluding 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2 spins:

0	1		0 sec.
1	5		3 sec.
2	16		3 sec.
3	46		2 sec.
4	110		3 sec.
5	224		2 sec.
6	437		3 sec.
7	865		3 sec.
8	1728		2 sec.
9	3456		3 sec.
10	6608		2 sec.
11	12332	2 sec.
12	23124	3 sec.
13	42558	3 sec.
14	73130	3 sec.
15	110414	3 sec.
16	140141	4 sec.
17	142095	3 sec.
18	104525	4 sec.
19	49157	3 sec.
20	12954	2 sec.
21	1728		3 sec.
22	106		2 sec.
total	725760	65 sec.

((2^9) * (9 !)) / 725 760 = 256, interesting :-) 

ok, now going the other direction: 

allowing just 1x1 and 1x2: 

0	1		  0 sec.
